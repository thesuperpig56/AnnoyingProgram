# AnnoyingProgram
Literally designed to be annoying but at random intervals.

Not meant to be destructive. Open-source in order to reveal it's code to even show that it ain't bad.

Use HaxeFlixel with Lime (SDL Opacity pull request).

Read the Project.xml in order to find all the Haxelibs required in order to compile this.
You also need Visual Studio Community 2022 Build Tools.

To build, all you have to do is open **Command Prompt**
and run ``lime build windows`` or ``lime test windows``
while being inside the repository in **Command Prompt**
